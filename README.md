vcluster Testing
================

A series of workshops for demonstrating the use of virtual clusters.

Workshops included are:

* [lab-shared-vcluster](workshops/lab-shared-vcluster) - A workshop
  demonstrating creation of a shared virtual cluster for the whole environment,
  with workshops users getting access to only a single namespace in the virtual
  cluster.

* [lab-remote-cluster](workshops/lab-remote-cluster) - A workshop demonstrating
  using a remote Kubernetes cluster, with workshops users getting access to only
  a single namespace in the remote cluster.
