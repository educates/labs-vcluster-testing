title: Kubernetes Dashboard
---

Even though a virtual cluster is being used which is notionally distinct from
the Kubernetes that this workshop session runs in, it is still possible to
enable the embedded Kubernetes dashboard, with it showing information from the
virtual cluster.

```dashboard:open-dashboard
name: Console
```

The Kubernetes extension for the embeded VS Code editor could also be installed
and used if desired.
